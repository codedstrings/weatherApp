##Overview
This is a simple weather application that uses the Visual Crossing Weather API to fetch weather data for a given location. Users can input their location into a form, and upon submission, the app fetches and displays the weather data in the console. This project is designed as a learning exercise to understand JavaScript, asynchronous programming, and error handling.
